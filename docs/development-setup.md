# Development Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up your development environment for building on BrickChain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Smart Contract Development with Compact

BrickChain smart contracts are written in **Compact**, a language designed for the Midnight network.

### Installing Compact

To get started with Compact, we recommend following the official Dev Diary for setting up the developer tools:

- **[Compact Developer Tools Setup Guide](https://docs.midnight.network/blog/compact-developer-tools)**

This guide will walk you through installing the necessary tools to compile, test, and deploy your Compact smart contracts.

### Smart Contract Resources

- **[OpenZeppelin Contracts for Compact](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts)**: A library of reusable and secure smart contracts.
- **[NFT Library for Midnight](https://github.com/riusricardo/midnight-contracts)**: A library for building NFT contracts.
- **[Compact Language Reference](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref)**: The official language reference for Compact.

## Frontend Development

For building user interfaces that interact with BrickChain, we recommend using **MidnightJS**.

### MidnightJS

**MidnightJS** is a JavaScript library that provides a simple and consistent interface for interacting with the Midnight network and smart contracts.

- **[MidnightJS Documentation](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js)**

### Connecting to Wallets

To connect your DApp to user wallets for read-only functionality and other interactions, you can use the **DApp Connector**.

- **[DApp Connector Documentation](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/dapp-connector)**

## Example Projects

To see how everything fits together, check out these example projects and resources:

- **[Awesome DApps Repo](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-awesome-dapps)**: A curated list of awesome DApps and resources for the Midnight network.
- **Starter Templates**: The `awesome-dapps` repository contains starter templates to help you get up and running quickly.

## Conclusion

With your environment set up, you are now ready to start building on BrickChain. Happy hacking!
