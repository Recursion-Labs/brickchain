## 🔍 Vision

Real estate trading is slow, paperwork-heavy, and full of intermediaries. **BrickChain** makes property trading as simple as sending cryptocurrency:

- **Tokenize** properties into fractional digital assets
- **Enable** private, seamless ownership transfers
- **Ensure** secure, verifiable proofs using zero-knowledge cryptography

With Midnight's privacy features, we create a compliant yet private foundation for global property markets.

## 🌟 Midnight Integration

### Core Features Powered by Midnight:

**🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
Property owners prove ownership without revealing sensitive documents

**🛡️ Shielded Transactions**  
Property fractions traded privately - balances remain confidential

**📋 Selective Disclosure**  
Show regulators only relevant proofs without exposing entire portfolio

## 📊 System Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Property Document] --> B[Hash Generation]
    B --> C[Smart Contract Registration]
    C --> D[Token Minting]
    D --> E[Fractional Ownership]
    E --> F[Shielded Transfer]
    F --> G[ZK Proof Generation]
    G --> H[Ownership Verification]
```

### Process Steps:

1. **Property Registration** → Document hash stored on-chain
2. **Tokenization** → Smart contract mints fractional tokens
3. **Trading** → Shielded transactions for private transfers  
4. **Verification** → ZK proofs for ownership confirmation

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Contracts**: Compact smart contracts for tokenization and property management
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for deployment and testing
- **App**: Frontend application for user interactions
- **Docker**: Containerized services for easy deployment
