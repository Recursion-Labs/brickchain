# üè† Midnight Real Estate Tokenization dApp ‚Äì Enhanced PRD

---

## 1. Vision

Property transactions today are **slow, document-heavy, and costly** due to middlemen and trust issues.  

**Our vision:**  
- Tokenize properties into **fractional digital assets**.  
- Enable **private, peer-to-peer trading** of property shares.  
- Use **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to prove ownership without exposing sensitive details.  

Midnight allows us to achieve **privacy-first property trading** while maintaining **compliance** and **simplicity**.

## 2. Core Problem

- **Slow Transactions** ‚Üí Legal/registry delays.  
- **Exclusivity** ‚Üí Only wealthy investors can buy property.  
- **Privacy Risks** ‚Üí Ownership details are often public.  
- **Forgery** ‚Üí Fake property documents undermine trust.

## 3. Solution with Midnight

### Key Features:
1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**  
   - Ownership proven without exposing full registry docs.  
   - Buyers verify property legitimacy without sensitive data leaks.  

2. **Shielded Transactions**  
   - Property tokens (fractions) transferred privately.  
   - Amounts + balances hidden unless disclosed.  

3. **Selective Disclosure**  
   - Owners disclose *only* relevant info to regulators/buyers.  
   - Example: *‚ÄúI own 20% of Property123.‚Äù*

## 4. User Journey (Step-by-Step)

1. **Property Registration**  
   - Upload property doc (dummy PDF for MVP).  
   - Hash generated (SHA-256) and stored on-chain.  
   - ZK proof links wallet ‚Üí property hash.  

2. **Tokenization (Allocation)**  
   - Owner sets property value + total token supply.  
   - Smart contract mints tokens (e.g., 1000 tokens = 100% ownership).  
   - Tokens allocated to owner‚Äôs wallet.  

3. **Selling / Transfer**  
   - Owner selects recipient + token amount.  
   - Shielded transaction executed via Midnight.  
   - Private balances updated.  

4. **Ownership Verification**  
   - Regulator/buyer requests proof.  
   - System generates **selective disclosure proof**.  
   - Example JSON response:  
     ```json
     {
       "propertyID": "hash123",
       "owner": "walletY",
       "share": "20%"
     }
     ```
